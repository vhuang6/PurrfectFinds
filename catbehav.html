                    <p align="left">"Way down deep, we're all motivated by the same needs," cartoonist Jim Davis, author of "Garfield," once stated. Cats have the fortitude to follow them." That could explain why cats act the way they do and are typically regarded as self-sufficient. Perhaps our cats are attempting to teach us a vital lesson by acting in the manner in which they were born. This isn't to say that our feline companions can't learn to behave in ways that are beneficial to the whole household. There is hope if your cat has excessive grooming habits, destructive kneading or scratching, or is a nighttime disruptor. Early intervention with behavior training, veterinary supervision, or a cat behavior specialist can help turn around cat behavior problems in general.
                    

                      <br><br>
Cats, like humans, have distinct personalities and traits. As a result, no official list of "typical" cat behavior exists. While there are many common feline behaviors, remember that each cat is unique and may act in slightly different ways depending on their personality, environment, or mood. Purring, grooming, kneading, and climbing are some of the most typical cat habits. However, each cat will engage in these activities in a unique way. Pay attention to your cat's behavior and figure out what is "normal" for him so you may spot any unexpected behavior that may necessitate a trip to the veterinarian.

                        Cats generally like high places and are excellent climbers. This behavior is genetic since cats are natural predators. A higher vantage point gives them a better view of their surroundings. Another practical reason for seeking a comfy ledge is to hide. Which can allow them to take advantage of the warmer air or settle down for a nice catnap without being disturbed. Interestingly, in a household of cats, the dominant cat usually occupies the highest perch. There are many types of cat perches that you can buy or make on your own, but make sure that the perch is safe and can hold the weight of your cat. If your cat enjoys climbing on high shelves or above the refrigerator and cabinets, make sure the area is clear of items that could hurt or trap your cat. And beware of falling objects.
                        <br><br>
                        Other cat behavior includes burying and scratching which is another instinct in all cats. Some cats will paw at the area around their food dish to mimic burying, as well as covering their tracks after using the litter box. Cats will naturally scratch to keep nails clean and to mark territory. Or course, cats may want to scratch furniture or walls, so make sure to provide more acceptable options like a scratching post. Cats prefer to scratch textures that are appealing, so you can discourage a cat from scratching certain areas by applying double-sided tape or aluminum foil. With a bit of patience, you can direct your cat to scratch acceptable objects and minimize unwanted scratches in the household.
                        <br><br>
                        Cats are also prone to curling up into a tight ball to sleep which provides warmth and security. A similar behavior is referred to as “loafing around” when cats curl their paws under to form a shape that looks like a little loaf of bread. This is done not only to look cute, but to regulate body heat and conserve warmth. Some cat behavior is simply the result of curiosity. While it may seem that cats are trying to type on the computer or enjoy pushing objects off a table or shelf, this behavior is common in many cats simply as a form of play. Also, cats probably enjoy watching the humans reacting to their mischievous antics. Again, pay attention to how your cat plays and take note if your cat’s behavior changes because there could be a medical reason for the change.

Cats convey their emotions through vocalizations. Meowing, purring, hisses, growls, and other feline sounds are all part of the repertoire, each with its own meaning depending on the situation. Adult cats do not ordinarily meow at each other, but domesticated cats have learnt to do so. Some studies believe cats use this behavior to manipulate their owners into giving them what they desire.
<br><br>
Cats purr because they want you to hear what they're saying, which essentially translates to "please stand still and listen to me." Pet cats purr when they want to be caressed, and kittens purr to convince their mothers to continue nursing them. The purr's vibrations have a relaxing impact on those who are exposed to it. Sick cats, on the other hand, purr as a call for aid. So purring doesn't always imply "I'm in a good mood." Purring's vibrations, according to some studies, may aid in the healing of bone injury in an injured cat.
