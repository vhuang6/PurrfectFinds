                    <p align="left">They are aware of their identities. We can sort of read their facial emotions. And some of them seem to like our company. These are some of the alleged findings of recent scientific research aiming at understanding the behavior of our most mysterious yet ubiquitous companions: pet cats.
                    

                      <br><br>
Cat communication and nonverbal cues can be perplexing at times. Cats have long been viewed as mysterious, solitary, and unpredictable creatures, maybe due to humans' inability to understand what they're saying. While humans communicate mostly through speaking, cats communicate primarily through silence. Cats communicate through a complicated system of body language, vocalization, and olfactory clues. To understand what your cat is saying to you and the other creatures in your home, learn how to recognize basic cat language and figure out the most prevalent combinations. 
<br><br>
With enough practice, you'll soon be an expert in cat language, and you might even be able to respond!

                        A happy cat is a clean cat, and we're here to assist! A little upkeep, from nail trimming to bathing, goes a long way. Continue reading to learn how to maintain your kitty's eyes, ears, teeth, skin, and fur clean and healthy. Please keep in mind that some cats do not like to be groomed. Please schedule an appointment with a professional groomer or a veterinarian to have your cat groomed if your cat fights the grooming process and there is a risk of injury to your cat or yourself. <br><br>
Although most cats are clean and rarely require a wash, you should brush or comb your cat on a regular basis. Brushing your cat's coat on a regular basis keeps it clean, decreases shedding, and reduces the likelihood of hairballs.

  Yes, even at home, you can groom your cat. Attempting to bathe or groom your kitty pet may appear absurd. They wiggle even when you use a comb, don't they? However, there are numerous advantages to keeping your cat's skin and hair in good shape. It makes them feel terrific and aids with their overall wellness.<br><br>
Your meticulous feline is well-equipped to handle their own hair care demands thanks to their built-in grooming equipment (tongue and teeth). You may need to give it a bath if it is particularly unclean or gets into something sticky or smelly. To ensure least stress and maximum productivity, follow these measures.
<br><br><br>
  <ol type = "1">
         <li align="left"><strong>Baths should be taken when your cat is at her most relaxed. </strong>Even the most feisty felines can be tired out by playing with a cat dancer or other toy of their choice.</li>
         <li align="left">Fluffy's <strong>claws should be trimmed before bathing </strong>strong>for your own safety.</li>
         <li align="left"><strong>Brush your cat thoroughly to eliminate any stray hair or mats.</strong> </li>
         <li align="left">To keep the water out, <strong>gently lay some cotton in her ears. </strong></li>
    <li align="left">
To prevent your cat from slipping, <strong>place a rubber bath mat in the sink or tub where you'll be bathing her. </strong>Fill three to four inches deep with lukewarm (not boiling!) water.  </li>
         <li align="left"><strong>Wet your pet thoroughly with a hand-held spray hose</strong>, being careful not to spray directly into her ears, eyes, or nose. If you don't have a spray hose, you can use a plastic pitcher or an unbreakable cup. </li>
         
         <li align="left"> Working from head to tail in the direction of hair development, <strong>gently massage your pet with a solution of one part cat shampoo (human shampoo might dry up her skin) to five parts water.</strong> Avoid touching your face, ears, or eyes. </li>
         <li align="left"><strong>Rinse your cat thoroughly </strong>with a spray hose or pitcher, making sure the water is lukewarm again. Take special care to remove all residue, as it can irritate the skin and function as a dirt magnet.</li>
