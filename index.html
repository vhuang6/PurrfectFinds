         Have you recently welcomed a 
         feline companion into your 
         home? Congratulations! We know 
         you'll be overjoyed to welcome 
         your new feline companion into 
         your home. Please visit your 
         local shelter if you are 
         thinking about adopting a cat. 
         To begin your search, look 
         through our directory of 
         adoptable cats in your region 
         or utilize our shelter finder. 
  <br><br>

         Read on for helpful hints for 
         new cat parents and those who 
         want to brush up on their pet-
         care knowledge.
                      <br><br>
Your pet should have her own clean, dry sleeping and resting area in your home. A nice, warm blanket or towel can be used to line your cat's bed. Make sure to wash your bedding on a regular basis. Please confine your cat to the house. Cats who live outside do not live as long as cats who live indoors. Cars, as well as battles with other cats, raccoons, and free-roaming canines, pose a threat to outdoor cats. Cats are known to be eaten by coyotes. Fleas and ticks are more likely to infest outdoor cats, and they are also more likely to get infectious diseases.

Cats convey their emotions through vocalizations. Meowing, purring, hisses, growls, and other feline sounds are all part of the repertoire, each with its own meaning depending on the situation. Adult cats do not ordinarily meow at each other, but domesticated cats have learnt to do so. Some studies believe cats use this behavior to manipulate their owners into giving them what they desire.
<br><br>
Cats purr because they want you to hear what they're saying, which essentially translates to "please stand still and listen to me." Pet cats purr when they want to be caressed, and kittens purr to convince their mothers to continue nursing them. The purr's vibrations have a relaxing impact on those who are exposed to it. Sick cats, on the other hand, purr as a call for aid. So purring doesn't always imply "I'm in a good mood." Purring's vibrations, according to some studies, may aid in the healing of bone injury in an injured cat.
